**What is this?**
This is a fully interactive portfolio built with **Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. It uses **Zustand** for state management and an **AI-powered Terminal** (OpenAI) to help you navigate.

**How to explore:**
- 🧠 **Terminal:** Ask the AI questions like 'Show me your Python projects' or use real commands like \`ls\` and \`cat\`.
- 💼 **Projects:** View my case studies (EcoNavix, Tributum, etc.). Click 'View Code' to see the actual source in VS Code!
- 📄 **Resume:** View my official CV in the PDF viewer.
- 📝 **VS Code:** A read-only editor to inspect my code snippets.

Feel free to drag windows, explore the dock, and test the AI. Enjoy!

- Sachin`
